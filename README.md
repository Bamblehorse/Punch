#Punch
*- A game called 'Punch'*


**Defined:**
> 1. Strike with the fist - "He punched her in the face and ran off"

> 2. Press (a button or key on a machine) - "I punched the button to summon the lift"

This game is a bit of both. It fulfills my long-term goal of making a text-based RPG with potentially infinite content, items and characters.
